    title: Registering Endpoints with IAM
    message: |
      When third-party platforms, command lines, and SDKs in the industry use IAM APIs to obtain tokens, IAM returns a catalog, which is a service catalog, including the name, type, and endpoint of a service.
      These tools obtain the endpoint based on the service type and add the URI of the resource object to access the APIs of related services.
      Therefore, all services that provide APIs must be registered with IAM.
      
      **(1)** Mandatory for the OpenStack service. 
      **(2)** Non-OpenStack services: Mandatory for Open Telekom Cloud (registration is required) except for other scenarios such as HUAWEI CLOUD (registration is not required).
    task: Ensure that the provided APIs are registered with IAM.
    option: Mandatory
